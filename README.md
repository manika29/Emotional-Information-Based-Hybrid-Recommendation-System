# Emotional-Information-Based-Hybrid-Recommendation-System
Although the techniques utilized in today's recommender systems were created more than a
decade earlier, the field is currently undergoing active research. The main objective of this
paper is to introduce an emotion enhanced method of recommending movies to the user.
The paper focuses on evaluating the model using Root Mean Squared Error and Mean
Absolute Error and developing a comparison on how an emotional information based
system is more accurate and efficient with respect to the hybrid model only. The result
shows that the emotional information-based hybrid model outperforms the hybrid models
statistically for a specific user. A graphical representation of the results has also been
demonstrated.
